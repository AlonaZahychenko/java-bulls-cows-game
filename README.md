This is a console-based implementation of the "Bulls and Cows" game written in Java. The player must guess a secret code composed of unique symbols. After each guess, the program provides feedback in the form of:

Bulls – correct symbols in the correct positions
Cows – correct symbols in the wrong positions

The game continues until the player successfully guesses the entire secret code.
